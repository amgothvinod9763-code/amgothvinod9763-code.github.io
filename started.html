  <p class="story-text">
    Bujji i was very excited when i was seen you coming to physics class with check shirt and i was stunning looking you and from that i started following you and it made me understand about you but i was got sad at that time you  had lived before me.
I was learning how to feel,Love didn’t ask us to be the same it only asked us to be honest.
    This was the beginning of us.
