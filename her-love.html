      Life was heavy for you, and many times I did not understand your feelings.
       Still, you stayed with me. You could have walked away, but you didn’t.
        You stayed even when your heart was tired.
       You never left me, and that means everything to me.

      Nothing was easy for you. Family pressure, fear, and pain were always around you. 
      Loving me was not simple bcz i overthink a lot i just waste shit,
       yet you tried in your own way. Even when things became difficult, you chose to stay.
       That strength in you is something I will always respect adn learn from you
